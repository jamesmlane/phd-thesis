\chapter{Introduction}

% I set the stage in this thesis with a look at the history of the study of Galaxies throughout the Universe. I then move on to the Milky Way in particular, and emphasize how its study has informed our understanding more broadly. Finally, I will summarize the main discoveries which have occurred in the \textit{Gaia} era, some being unexpected, and some validating or disproving past hypotheses.
